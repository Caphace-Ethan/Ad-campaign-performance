# Ad-campaign-performance
### - Ad campaign performance Testing using A/B Hypothesis Testing


### Classic and sequential A/B testing analysis on "Ad campaign performance"

- The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand "Lux" awareness. 

### Hypothesis of this Analysis:
#### 1. Null Hypothesis(Ho) -> "There is no difference in brand awareness between the exposed and control groups in the current case"

#### 2. Alternate Hypothesis(Ha) -> "There is difference in brand awareness between the exposed and control groups in the current case"


### Variables for our A/B Testing Analysis:
#### 1. A control group - users that were shown the dummy ad,
#### 2. A Exposed/experimental group - Users that were shown the Creative ad.


## Required: 
### 1.2.1 Performing data exploration to count unique values of categorical variables, make histogram, relational, and other necessary plots to help understand the data.

### 1.2.2 Performing hypothesis testing: applying the classical p-value based algorithm and the  sequential A/B testing algorithm

### The Analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook file named "Sequential_AB_Testing_Analysis.ipynb", in "notebook" folder
